A GameJS game. The objective is to maintain your mental health without being violated by...

This game is entirely build over the HTML Canvas element, using a customized
version of [GameJS](http://gamejs.org) that is
[AMD](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/AsynchronousDefinition) compliant
and has some bugfixes that I will try to contribute to the project later.
[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) is used as the AMD implementation.
Custom GameJS version is forked from (https://github.com/volrath/game-off-2012/tree/master/static/js/libs/gamejs)
